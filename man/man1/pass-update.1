.SH COMMAND
.TP

     [\fI--length=<size>\fP, \fI-l <size>\fP] [ \fI--edit\fP, \fI-e\fP ]
     [ \fI--multiline\fP, \fI-m\fP ] \fIpass-names...\fP

Update the password provided: print the password and wait for the user to
generate a new one.

.I pass-names
can refer either to password store path(s) or to directory. Both path and
directory can be given in the same command. When updating a directory, all the
password in this directory are updated. Wildcard update are supported by quoting
\fI'*'\fP sign.

Both old and newly generated password can optionally be written on the clipboard
using the \fI--clip\fP or \fI-c\fP option.

If \fI--no-symbols\fP or \fI-n\fP is specified, do not use any non-alphanumeric
characters in the generated password.

Specific password length can be given using \fI--length\fP or \fI-l\fP is
specified, along with a numerical argument.

If \fI--provide\fP or \fI-p\fP is specified, let the user specify a password by
hand. The user will have to confirm the password.

If \fI--multiline\fP or \fI-m\fP is specified, update a multiline password.
Beware this option will ovewrite the full password file instead of updating
the password field.

If \fI--edit\fP or \fI-e\fP is specified, edit the password using the default
editor. This editor can be specified with \fIEDITOR\fP.

If \fI--force\fP or \fI-f\fP is specified, pass update does not wait for the
user and generate a new password immediately.

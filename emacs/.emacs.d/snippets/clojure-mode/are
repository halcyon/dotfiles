#name: are
# Ensures the following best practices are honored:
#  * Bindings are best expressed in `[input expected]` order. It's most intuitive to create an Input->Output mapping, not O->I
#  * The `=` call is passed in `expected input` order, because that's the clojure.test API.
#  * There's a `testing`, for informative reporting, did the test fail
#  * There's a `true` at tail position, so that failures aren't duplicated or confusing.
